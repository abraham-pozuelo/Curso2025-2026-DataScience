### Analysis
### Ontology
    - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
    - rdfs:SubClassOf is not correctly written.
    - You are defining datatype properties as classes, which is wrong.
    - The file with the example of instantiating the ontology is missing.
### RDF data
    - Fix character encoding issues.
    - Datatypes are missing.
