### Analysis
### Ontology
    - You will need to create links between entities in your dataset (i.e., instances of the classes) and the same entities in other datasets. It is not clear which types of entities (i.e., classes) will be linked.
### RDF data
    - The observations include all the values together, so it is not clear which value corresponds to what.
