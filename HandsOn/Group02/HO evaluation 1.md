### Analysis
### Ontology
    - Check that all property names start with non-capital letter.
    - Fix the name of the class BicisComparidas.
    - You will need to create links between entities in your dataset (i.e., instances of the classes) and the same entities in other datasets. It is not clear which types of entities (i.e., classes) will be linked.
    - The ontology does not contain datatype properties and only contains one object property.
    - The domain and/or range of properties is not defined.
    - The file with the example of instantiating the ontology is missing.
### RDF data
    - The file with the queries is missing.
